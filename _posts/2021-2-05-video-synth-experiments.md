Some patches from my [video synthesizer]({{ '/video-synth' | relative_url }})

---

I've added a lot of features since my last video synthesizer post! Here's some
art I've made with it. I think I'm starting to get the hang of intentionally
composing effects instead of stumbling upon them (though my process is still
mostly trying random combinations to see what they do).

Hover your mouse over the canvases to see the animations! (Note that if you're
on chrome and you see nothing below, this is a known bug - I'll fix it one day!)
