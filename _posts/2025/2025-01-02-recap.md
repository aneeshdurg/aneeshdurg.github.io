# personal life

I got engaged this year! We're very happy to be together and I'm very excited to spend my life with
my partner.

This year my fiance(!!!) and I hosted a lot of social gatherings. At times we stretched ourselves a
bit thin and had too many social plans in the same time. But we made some awesome memories and built
a really amazing community. Parts of this year were pretty tough for me, and I think having so many
people that I knew were supporting me really helped me get through the dark times. I'd like to keep
that community going in 2025.

# fitness

I haven't been as consistent as I would have liked this past year. But I did hit two "big" goals. I
ran my longest run (15mi) and biked my longest ride (100mi). Although I wasn't consistent throughout
the year, I did have stretches where I established a decent routine, and found myself getting more
comfortable doing harder training rides and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone.

Next year, I have a few goals - I'd like to run a full marathon, and I'd like to do another 100mi
ride, but these goals are really proxies to get me to be more consistent. I think I've found some
really good communities through fitness and I'm really grateful for that this year.

I did buy a new bike this year - my first real road bike, a Canyon Enudrace CF8.

It's so fun to ride. I'm glad my first "real" bike was a gravel bike, because I think starting with
something this nice would have spoiled me. I'm totally sold on electronic shifting and carbon frames
now. I think buying this bike has solidified my identity as a cyclist - I no longer feel like I
don't "deserve" a bike this nice, and I feel like I have the right to say that I belong in the
cycling community. Of course, this has been true all along, but now I am aware of that truth.

# cooking

At the start of the year I was really struggling to cook consistently and found myself spending way
more on eating out than I would have liked. I think I've turned it around. My partner and I have
gotten a good routine established, and we only eat out once or twice a week. I've been approaching
my craving for novelty by trying out new recipes from cookbooks and experimenting around a bit more.
I think I've gotten a lot better at making pastas and soups - for a while my partner had banned me
from making pasta, but over the course of this year the ban has been lifted, and my new and improved
pasta recipes are a new staple in our household.

# reading

I hit my reading goal! It was definitely looking a little dicey towards the end but we made it.
Checkout my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62773213-aneesh-durg) for details on
books I read this year. Favorite book of the year would have to be [Chip
War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_War:_The_Fight_for_the_World%27s_Most_Critical_Technology)
it gave me a good understanding of the historical context behind the tech industry.

# projects

![github]({{ '/static/images/2025-01-02-recap/gh.png' | relative_url }})

Last year I told myself that this would be the year of quality over quantity. That I would only
start a few new projects and instead choose to put in solid work on projects that I already had in
progress. Anyway, Here's every new repository I created last year:

### [monkeywrench](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/monkeywrench)

This was a tool that integrated Github Copilot into firefox's devtools. It was my first time writing
an extension that used the devtools API, and my first (and only?) project that used LLMs. It's a
cool idea, but it's honestly pretty bad at what it was supposed to do - lower the barrier of entry
to interacting with webpages via scripting. At some point I'd like to revisit this project.

### [multiversionpython](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/multiversionpython)

This was a proof of concept to getting python to allow importing multiple versions of the same
library in python. It's really cursed. Honestly one of my favorite things that I made this year.

### [toposim](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/toposim)

This was actually a repo I made for a research project with University of Washington. It's a
framework for running distributed applications on custom graph topologies in Docker. I think the
coolest part of it is the template based script generation. It uses Jinja to generate shell scripts
that can access information about the topology of the entire experiment. At some point I started
adding a set of scripts to take the virtualized setup and deploy it on physical machines.

### [pyllvmpass](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/pyllvmpass)

This is a tool I built to make it easier to write LLVM passes in python. It was my first Rust
project in a long time, but also used some of my python skills in interacting with `C` libraries (at
least during debugging). Someone remarked that it was funny that I wrote this in Rust instead of
`C++`, and that it's a real testament that to write a library that interfaces with a `C`/`C++` API,
I prefer Rust instead of `C` or `C++` itself.

### [graphgen](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/graphgen)

Again related to my research, this is a fast tool to generate large synthetic graphs with controlled
distributions on edges and on property sizes. It was original just a python script in a private
repo, but the script proved to be too slow as I wanted to test larger scales. I decided it was a
good time to learn some more Rust and learn how to write performant Rust code. I used it as a good
learning opportunity to learn about performance profiling tools in Rust.

### [xyboard](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/xyboard)

I've written a series of blog posts about this already, but this was a project I resumed work on
that I abandoned back in 2020. I won't write much about this here, but it was a fun distraction this
year, and I'll probably keep working on it eventually.


### [argparsh](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/argparsh)

I've written a couple blog posts about this, but this is one of the most useful things I built this
year. I use it for so many of my personal and research scripts these days. Good command line parsing
is so nice. It was my first non-trivial Rust project of year, and I think working on this gave me a
lot more confidence in approaching Rust development.

### [nvparse_rs](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/nvparse_rs)

I've written about this project at length as well. I feel like I understand GPU programming so much
better than before starting, and the performance analysis I've done has also given me a better
intuition for when GPUs can speed up compute, and by how much compared to threads.

### [buffcat](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/buffcat)

After working on `graphgen` and building datasets for `nvparse_rs`, I realized that what I wanted
was `cat` but more capable of combining large files without OOM'ing and a few other options like
repeating a file's contents multiple times. Built with performance in mind it's multithreaded. I
prototyped this in python, then rewrote it in Rust. What I loved about this process was learning
that `tqdm` has a Rust port, and that the Rust version deals with multiple threads much better than
the python version.

### [pystats](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/pystats)

A small tool for taking in streams of data and computing stats and visualizations. Pretty useful for
some quick and dirty data exploration.

### [meshdeformation](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/meshdeformation)

My only art project in 2024. I wrote a blog post about this, but it gave me a chance to play around
with WebGPU and WGSL in the browser. Fun times.

## (real) OSS contributions
I opened the following PRs this year:
+ [type annotations for numba's @intrinsic](https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/9401)
+ [a bug fix for a really cool allocator](https://github.com/plasma-umass/Mesh/pull/106)
+ [updating dependencies for LDBC's SNB dataset generator](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_bi/pull/174)
+ [a bug fix for a UT research repo](https://github.com/utcs-scea/pando-mono/pull/114)
+ [a performance improvement for a graph library](https://github.com/IntelligentSoftwareSystems/Galois/pull/423)
+ [updates to a rust-gpu example to use the latest versions of it's deps](https://github.com/andrusha/rust-gpu-wgpu-compute-minimal/pull/1)

## (slightly less real) OSS contributions
+ [hostfile](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/hostfile)
    + It always amazes me to realize that people out there actually use code that I wrote. I
      received a couple PRs from the community and released a couple new versions this year.
+ [NoteDown](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/notedowm)
    + I only did a little cleanup this year, but I'm hoping to onboard a new contributor to this
      project soon! It'll be this person's first time working on an open source project and I
      hope that this can prove to be a really good learning ground for them.
+ [rainbow](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/rainbow)
    + I played around with re-implementing this as an LLVM pass, but the analysis is definitely
      way harder to do for constructs like lambdas. I was hoping to turn this into a research
      project and publish something about using graph DBs as a compiler/PL tool. The hope isn't
      dead, I just haven't been able to pursue that avenue as much as I wish I could have last
      year.

## this blog

One of my goals last year was to really make this blog come alive. I wanted to post at least twice a
month and also focus the blog on my research directions a bit better. This has been a resounding
success. Pictures are worth a thousand words, so here's a visualization of my post frequency:

![post frequency]({{ '/static/images/2025-01-02-recap/freq.png' | relative_url }})

I hope to keep this momentum going. I feel myself getting better at writing, and with engaging with
my thoughts to determine what thoughts I think are worth cataloging.

# work/academia

I applied to grad school, then quit my job. Was that the right decision? I think it was. I was
pretty unhappy at my old role (many reasons for this, not trying to put blame on the company
itself), and quitting has given me some freedom to recover from burnout - something I've been
running from for years. I hope to make the most of this interlude while I wait to hear back from
universities. I'd really really like to start my PhD in 2025, but if it doesn't work out I do have
some backup plans.

The process of applying was arduous. I went through so many iterations of my statement of purpose,
but I think it was time well spent. I have so much more clarity on what I hope to accomplish with a
PhD program than I did when I started, and I feel more convinced than ever that I'm on the right
path. So many people helped me on this journey this year and I'm eternally grateful for that. Here's
to hoping that those efforts will come to fruition. Fingers crossed.

In terms of research itself, there were highs and lows, and I think my biggest takeaway is that
I enjoy the work I do, but sometimes when I tie my self worth to my results it's hard for me to
acknowledge that I'm having fun. I've learned some good life lessons this year, and next year I hope
to accomplish more sustainably.

# Conclusion

2024 was an eventful year. Overall, my emotion for the year is gratitude. I'm grateful for my
amazing fiance and the life we've built together. I'm grateful for the awesome people that made this
a special year. I'm grateful for all the insane opportunities that came my way and the lasting
impacts they've had on me - in 2023 the idea that I would be a researcher seemed like a pipe dream,
but now it's a reality. I'm grateful for my health.

Here's to 2025 being no less exciting!
