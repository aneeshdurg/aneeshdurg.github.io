Genuary is a series of prompts to inspire generated art in the month of January.
You can find a list of the prompts here:

You can see all of my genuary art and more by following me on twitter:

Today's prompt was `Circles only`.  I drew some circles that all fit into each
other and rotate around the center of their parent. Then I had only the centers
of every circle be rendered. Click `Toggle drawing mode ` to see what I mean!
