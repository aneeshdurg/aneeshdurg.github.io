Another day of [#genuary](https://genuary2021.github.io) - this time with vaporwave

---

Genuary is a series of prompts to inspire generated art in the month of January.
You can find a list of the prompts here:

The prompt for today was `"Do some code golf!"`
Here's what I came up with:

The colors make it feel very vaporwave-esque to me.

To start, I didn't really have any ideas, so I started by thinking about what
makes codegolf easy. I needed to use something that provided the boilerplate
code so that I could say that my code fits into a tweet guilt-free. I thought
about trying out `pico8`, but decided to use `shadertoy` instead. My project
[webgl playground]({{ '/webgl-playground' | relative_url }}) is based off of
`shadertoy`, but I've never actually written a `shadertoy`.

I spent some time experiementing with various ideas, but I won't share the
experiments I didn't use here since I might use them as a starting point for
some upcoming prompts. Once I settled on the idea I wanted to use, trimming to
code to fit `280` characters was a fun challenge.

A really neat idea that I kept coming back to was the idea of subdivding the
space into a grid and having effects that constrain to that grid. In my opinion
that creates a very satisfying visual effect.
