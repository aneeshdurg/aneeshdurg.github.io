I decided to sort my bookmarks and thought it might be fun to write about it.

## Updates about myself and this blog (it's related to this post, I promise)

Really quick update about blogging. I made an account on
[sourcehut](https://sr.ht) and I'm hosting a copy of this blog there at
[aneesh.srht.site/](https://aneesh.srht.site/). Don't go there just yet! It's
broken since sourcehut pages serves websites with a content source policy of
`default-src`. What that means is that all dependencies on external resources
cannot be loaded. I'm trying to decide what to do with that page. I'm thinking I
may keep some kind of static personal (non-technical) blog there. Maybe I'll
even set it up as a HTTP mirror of a gemlog or something.

In other news (and motivating this post), I started a new job this month. It's
been really fun so far, and I'm learning a lot about what it means to write
`C++` again. I'll probably write a couple more blog posts about what I've
learned recently (in case I forget, it's about re-learning c++, abstractions for
date/time, how to learn how to navigate a new codebase, and probably something
about data structures and how we think about
them). Anyway, as a part of all this I've gained a few new bookmarks and I
thought it was a good time to do some spring cleaning of my bookmarks.

I've sorted things into broad categories below.

## Tools
+ [RANDOM.ORG](random.org)
    + A random number generator
    + these days I would probably just use javascript's `Math.random` instead
      when I need it.
+ Library Genesis (I won't link it here because I don't support piracy)
+ [generatedpaper.com](generatedpaper.com/en)
    + Templates to download and print various kinds of paper (e.g. graph, ruled, etc.)
    + This was very useful when I was in highschool. Not useful anymore.
+ [Free Class Schedule Maker](https://www.freecollegeschedulemaker.com/)
    + Paste in your college schedule and it'll generate a `.ics` file you can
      import into google calendar.
+ [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)
    + Draw a symbol and find out what latex identifier it is
+ [Wayback Machine](http://www.archive.org/web/web.php)
    + Sometimes I go add snapshots of things like course pages from my
      university. As a student I really appreciated being able to see history
      like that.
+ [Austin Bike Map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5d0284294f1b41bcad4ea956274a83b3&extent=3084002.7769,10048871.3815,3148002.7769,10081338.0481,102739)
    + I don't have a bike here at the moment, but if I did this would be useful.

## Nerd content
+ [Green thread explained](https://c9x.me/articles/gthreads/code0.html)
    + As a TA in college I used this as a reference to make a green threading
      lab for students to implement. Fun times - learned a lot about debugging
      and profiling.
+ [Hidden features of C - stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132241/hidden-features-of-c)
+ [PEP 483 - The theory of type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/)
+ [Subpixel Text Encoding](http://www.msarnoff.org/millitext/)
+ [Implement TCP in Rust (part1)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzja9fQWzdA?popout=1&autoplay=1&loop=0&controls=1&modestbranding=0&start=1341)
    + I'll finish watching this video series someday!


## Visualizations
+ [The internet map](http://internet-map.net/)
+ [The scale of the universe 2](https://htwins.net/scale2/?bordercolor=white)
+ [A blog with cool visualizations](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/art/)

## Cool/novelty software
+ [Instant Rimshot](http://instantrimshot.com/)
    + Useful if you want a rimshot sound effect when hanging out with friends.
      I've never used it.
+ [Big Backup](https://devpost.com/software/bigbackup-th7fjb)
    + Use youtube as a general purpose file storage server
+ [Clang in the browser](https://tbfleming.github.io/cib/#gist=2f7baf1120967895c2b07b09eddb576c)
    + Arguable godbolt is way more useful, but I love the idea of having a
      webassembly compiler in my browser. I've never actually used it though.
+ [The Useless Web](http://www.theuselessweb.com/)

## Art
+ [Simple Desktops](https://simpledesktops.com/browse/)
    + Find minimalist wallpapers
+ [Simon Stålenhag Art Gallery](Simon Stålenhag Art Gallery)
    + Surreal artist
+ [https://xkcd.com/1110/](https://xkcd.com/1110/)
+ [http://www.mangareader.net/nasa](http://www.mangareader.net/nasa)
    + I don't know why the stories in this anthology had such an impact on me,
      but I was really drawn to them. It made me think about what elements in a
      story really create a sense of character.
+ [fleep](http://www.shigabooks.com/strips/fleep/scrollindex.html)
+ [some comic about an inventor that I can't remember the plot of](http://www.nickstjohn.net/fm1.html)
+ [rainymood](https://www.rainymood.com/)
    + Background rain sound effect
+ [tunefind](https://www.tunefind.com/)
    + Find out what songs are used in TV shows/movies.
+ [net.artgenerator](http://nag.iap.de/?ac=create)
    + This used to take in search queries and it would mix images from the
      search results together to create some funky looking images.
    + I think it's broken now.

## Games
I'm sure some of these are broken now.

+ [Google pacman](http://google.com/pacman/)
+ [Ball pool](http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball-pool/)
+ [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)
    + I remember doing speedrun races of this game with my friends in
      highschool. Good times.
+ [10 fast fingers](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english)
    +  Still do this all the time. Currently I'm at 93 WPM - but only with my
       split ortholinear keyboard. I'm more like 80 on a regular keyboard.
+ [Flappy48](https://broxxar.itch.io/flappy48)
    + About as 2014 as it gets.
+ [goscurry](http://www.goscurry.com/index.php)
    + During the alpha for the game you used to be able to play a demo on the
      website for free. It was pretty fun, maybe I'll buy it someday.
+ [Akinator, the Web Genius](http://en.akinator.com/)
    + I grew up in the early 2000s, can't you tell? I'm surprised I never
      bookmarked miniclip or armorgames, but I guess I still remember those
      websites more than a decade later.
    + I've found that akinator is no longer as accurate as it used to be. I
      guess as it's database of people has expanded, it's harder for it to
      narrow down the pool of candidates. The magic of having it guess whoever
      you were thinking of (including yourself!) is lost.
+ [Find the Invisible Cow](http://www.findtheinvisiblecow.com/)
+ [Boss Rush](https://sharenator.com/Boss_Rush/)
    + This link is broken, but maybe you can view the content via wayback
      machine or find the game elsewhere?
    + I miss flash games
+ [Box Dodge Fury](http://www.sharenator.com/Box_Dodge_Fury/)
    + same as above
+ [pretentious game](http://armorgames.com/play/13225/pretentious-game)
    + broken - but at least I found out armor games still exists and is trying
      to preserve flash content via `Ruffle`.
    + Clicking on the link and not seeing the old armorgames logo/website
      aesthetic made a little sad.
+ [spreeder - learn to speed read](http://www.spreeder.com/app.php?intro=1)
    + I have always been a speed reader, which honestly has worked against me my
      entire life.
    + This isn't exactly a game, but it can be if you're bored.

## Memes
A lot of these probably aren't funny anymore, but they were hilarious when I was
13 I guess.

+ [Things you can say in response to literally anything](http://arcaneloquence.tumblr.com/post/140358623151/things-you-can-say-in-response-to-literally)
+ [comics made from CAPTCHAs](https://imgur.com/a/Ddy2I)
+ [7 deadly sins](https://imgur.com/a/bqiSO)
+ [Halloween themed puns](https://imgur.com/a/bxJHK?gallery)
+ [Is your son a computer hacker](http://www.adequacy.org/stories/hacker.comments.page.1.html)
    + I only read cryptonomicon because of this article.
+ [psychosis - creepypasta](http://www.creepypasta.com/psychosis/)
+ [penpal - creepypasta](https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Penpal)
    + I was listening to some `sidewalks & skeletons` while reading this the
      first time. Really added to the ambience.

## Memories
+ [Tie-a-Tie.net](http://www.tie-a-tie.net/)
    + Learn how to tie a tie in multiple styles - a lifesaver in highschool when
      I had to wear a uniform with a tie.
+ [Virtual haircut audio illusion](http://www.moillusions.com/2007/04/virtual-haircut-audio-illusion-mp3.html)
    + This was before ASMR was a thing, so the concept of stereo audio being
      used to replicate 3d space was mind blowing to me.
    + I discovered this website through an old windows 7 desktop widget that
      showed a new optical illusion everyday.
+ A collection of ROMs and guides for the `XOLO Q800`
    + I won't link them here - I doubt any of my readers still have a cheap
      smartphone that only retailed in asia 8 years ago.
    + That honestly was the best phone I ever had for the price I paid. It
      worked for almost three years, and I only swapped it out because I was
      tired of seeing a few dead pixels from some bad drops. I never even had a
      case on the thing.
+ A collection of URLs for planning a trip to Japan
    + A bunch of my friends and I wanted to go on a trip to Japan after
      highschool. All of our parents unanimously shot the idea down pretty
      quickly.
    + We thought we were so clever by tell each of our parents that the other
      parents had already agreed, but we didn't account for the fact that they
      could actually call each other.
+ Too Many Tabs
    + This was a firefox extension for tab management. It doesn't work anymore,
      but it worked by storing sets of tabs as bookmark folders.
    + Simple tab groups is a good replacement

## Conclusion

That was a fun exercise, it was nice to remember things from my past. I deleted
most of the links I encountered, since they're all captured here now! My
bookmarks seems so strange and empty now.
