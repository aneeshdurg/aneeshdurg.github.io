* I am a student of Mathematics & Computer science at the university of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I love math and computer science equally.
* I love reading/writing, checkout my [goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62773213-aneesh-durg) and some [short stories](http://interstellarbroadcast.tumblr.com/) I wrote a long time ago.
